- quote from an IBM paper
> “Defining a corelet as a class in an OOP framework grants us encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, and dramatically improves the design, structure, modularity, correctness, consistency, compactness and reusability of code,” Modha and a team of IBM researchers wrote in a paper on the language.
